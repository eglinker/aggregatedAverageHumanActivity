# CODEBOOK FOR AGGREGATED AVERAGE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING SMARTPHONE’S DATA SET

##  **Introduction**
The variables in this tidy data set represent aggregated average values of raw data obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone’s Data Set [1].  The original source data set is obtained at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The original data set consists of data generated by the accelerometers and gyro scopes of the Samsung Galaxy S II phone.  Phones were worn by 30 subjects while they performed six different activities.

##  **Merges, extractions and transformations**
The final data set was produced by modifying and transforming the original data set as follows:

* Merge data from training and test data set files below into single data frame:X_train.txt,  y_train.txt, X_test.txt', y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt

* Extract only mean and standard deviations from original data set.

* Replace numbers designating activities in original data set with descriptive activity names from file named activity_labels.txt.

* Make labels from table more appropriate for the final tidy dataset by using string substitutions and by removing “untidy characters” such as), -, (, _, and coma. 

* The averages are aggregated for each activity and subject.
