# Aggregated Average for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset 
R script and new tidy data file by Erich Glinker.

August 23, 2014
##  **Introduction**
This repo contains a tidy data set stored in a file named **tidydata.txt**.  This tidy data set represents aggregated average values of raw data obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone’s Data Set [1].  The original raw data set consists of data generated by the accelerometers and gyro scopes of the Samsung Galaxy S II phone.  Phones were worn by 30 subjects while they performed six different activities.  See original raw data set at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The tidy data set is generated by transforming the raw data set using R language script named **run_analysis.R**, this script is included I this repo.  The output file will be named tidydata.txt.  See code book for tidydata.txt file details.

## **Raw Data Source**
 The original raw data set was obtained at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The following raw data files are required from within the raw data set to generate the tidy data set, all other files in the raw data set may be disregarded:

X_train.txt,  y_train.txt, X_test.txt', y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt


##  **Procedure Implemented Within the Script**
The final data set was produced using running an R language script named run_analysis.R.  This script is written assuming that it can be run as long as the raw data files are in the working directory.  The script works by extracting, modifying and transforming the original raw data set as follows:

* Merge data from training and test data set files below into single data frame:X_train.txt,  y_train.txt, X_test.txt', y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt

* Extract only mean and standard deviations from original data set.

* Replace numbers designating activities in original data set with descriptive activity names from file named activity_labels.txt.

* Make labels from table more appropriate for the final tidy dataset by using string substitutions and by removing “untidy characters” such as), -, (, _, and coma. 

* The averages are aggregated for each activity and subject.
 
## **Values of Variables in the Tidy Data Set File**

The values for the variable **subject** are Integer values ranging [1,30]. For **trainingLabels** the values of training labels include WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING.  A other variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

##  **Directions**

Follow the directions below to reproduce the tidy data set.

**Step 1.** Make sure to use RStudio version  0.98.994 (for best results)

**Step 2.** Make sure to use R x64 version 3.1.1 (for best results)

**Step 3.** Download data raw data set zip file from link below:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**Step 4.** Create fresh directory and place the script run_analysis.R in that directory.

**Step 5.** Copy the following raw data files from the raw data zip files into the directory that contains run_analysis.R:

**Step 6.** Start up the RStudio and use it to run the script  run_analysis.R.  This will generate the tidy data set representing averages of data aggregated for each activity and subject.  The output file will be named tidydata.txt
